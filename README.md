**ESSENCE** 

As it is a basic object oriented concept project using JAVA language, I am developing a system for some **real-life problem solution**. It may not be up to the mark because that’s a basic project, but the idea will be same and implementation can be better in some experienced hands. Those real-life problem features which are added to this system are not enough, anytime any features can be added to system. Here, I’m implementing some problem’s solution which I recently faced at the time problem solving.  

**Features**  

- Registration (Though it is a personal system but I’m Implementing registration feature for those who is verified by me. Primarily I am the Admin and also the user) 

✓  Passwords Validator ( This is an Important feature ) 

- **The password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter and a number;** 
- **It can’t have any punctuation character, accent or space;** 
- **Moreover, the password must be 6 to 32 characters**. 
- Log-In (  Every time user have login by user-id and password) 

**Solutions** 

- Text  Corrector  **(In  many  languages  a  rule  must  be  followed  when writing any digital text do not use white spaces before a comma or a period. removes any whitespace that is immediately succeeded by a comma or a period. If there is more than one such whitespace, just removes one of them.)**
- **Daily Health Tracker** **( This feature will take input from user regarding his/her daily activity and will show the result of his daily health according the input)** 
- **Study Tracker ( This feature will take input from user regarding his/her daily Study and will show the result of his daily study according the input)** 
- **Food Consuming Calculator (This is a very large feature in real-life and  that  whole  feature  can’t  be  implement  here.  So,  I  am implementing only for fruit consumption).**  
- **Economic Crisis Tracker (This feature will help you to understand, the status of our economic condition. This feature is based on user input and the condition of the bank reserve and the loan amount).**
